With your PowerMate plugged in via USB, turn the knob to control a MIDI parameter. Press-and-turn the knob to control a second MIDI parameter.

Enable or disable MIDI and OSC messages via the menu bar icon.

Theoretically works with multiple PowerMates, but this functionality has not yet been tested.

_Note: powermate2midi does not work while Griffin's PowerMate app is running. Make sure to quit Griffin's app if it's running in the dock or menu bar._
