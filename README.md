With your PowerMate plugged in via USB, turn the knob to control a MIDI parameter, or press-and-turn the knob to control a second MIDI parameter.

Click the PowerMate icon in your menu bar to enable or disable MIDI and OSC messages.

Theoretically works with multiple PowerMates, but this functionality has not yet been tested.
